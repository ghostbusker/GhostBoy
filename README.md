download latest r̶a̶s̶p̶b̶i̶a̶n̶ ̶l̶i̶t̶e̶ RaspbianOS Lite image and burn to SD card. Instert into any model of pi with attached keyboard and monitor (or connect over ssh, you may also need to adjust the keyboard layout). run the following command and shutdown. insert sd card into Retroflag GPI Case and run. You may have to add a wpa_supplicant.conf file to the sd-card to get the network share on your local network. it probs wont work for you on the  first try. good luck!
